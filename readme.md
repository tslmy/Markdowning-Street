Markdowning Street
==================

A bi-directed Markdown editor in __HTML__&__JS__.

Main Features
-------------
### Bi-directed Conversion
Not only can you turn Markdown-formatted text into HTML in _real time_, but also can you reversely convert HTML into Markdown!
### Drag Open
You can open a `.txt` file by dragging it into the left part of the webpage!

This requires the support of HTML5 File API from your browser, so old browsers won't taste it.

Addition: It seems that this functionality only works when you are visiting this webpage on server, otherwise the content won't show up.

Thanks for these people. Their works are the foundation and I was just, at most, a tailor who combined them together.
